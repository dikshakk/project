Overview
A supermarket billing system is a computerized system that facilitates the checkout process and manages the financial transactions in a supermarket or grocery store. It is designed to streamline the billing process, improve accuracy, and enhance efficiency in retail operations.
Overall, a supermarket billing system automates and streamlines the checkout process, provides accurate pricing information, manages inventory, and generates detailed reports for efficient store management. It enhances customer satisfaction by minimizing waiting times and errors while enabling retailers to make data-driven decisions for business growth.


Data Structures Used In Program
Hashing is a data structure and algorithm that is widely used in various applications, including in a supermarket billing system. It is an efficient method for storing and retrieving data, particularly when fast access to data is required. Hashing provides efficient data retrieval by reducing the search space using the hash function. However, collisions can occur when multiple keys map to the same index, resulting in the need for collision resolution strategies such as chaining or open addressing.
Overall, hashing data structures offer fast access and retrieval of data, making them valuable in scenarios where quick lookups are required, such as in a supermarket billing system to manage product information, customer details, or other relevant data.
